# Project Title: 0x1D. C - Binary Trees

Description:

The project "0x1D. C - Binary Trees" focuses on the implementation and manipulation of binary trees using the C programming language. Binary trees are fundamental data structures that play a crucial role in various applications, including search algorithms, data organization, and hierarchical representation.

Key Objectives:

1. **Binary Tree Implementation:** Develop a robust implementation of binary trees, ensuring proper memory allocation, node creation, and tree structuring in the C programming language.

2. **Basic Operations:** Implement essential operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order) for binary trees. These operations form the foundation for more complex functionalities.

3. **Binary Search Tree (BST):** Extend the basic binary tree implementation to support the creation and manipulation of Binary Search Trees. Implement algorithms to maintain the BST properties during insertions and deletions.

4. **Tree Traversal Algorithms:** Implement various tree traversal algorithms, providing a deeper understanding of the different ways to explore and process the elements within a binary tree.

5. **Binary Tree Height and Balance:** Develop functions to calculate the height of a binary tree and determine its balance factor. Explore techniques to maintain a balanced tree structure, such as AVL trees or Red-Black trees.

6. **Advanced Operations:** Implement advanced operations, including finding the lowest common ancestor, checking if a tree is symmetric, and validating whether a given binary tree is a valid BST.

7. **Performance Analysis:** Conduct performance analysis on the implemented binary tree operations. Evaluate time and space complexity to understand the efficiency of the algorithms in different scenarios.

8. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation, including comments within the code, explaining the purpose of each function, algorithmic approach, and usage examples.

9. **Testing:** Develop a robust testing suite to validate the correctness of the implemented functions and ensure the stability of the binary tree operations under various scenarios and edge cases.

10. **Usage Examples:** Provide practical examples demonstrating the application of binary trees in real-world problems. Showcase the versatility of binary trees in solving different computational challenges.

By the end of the project, participants will gain a solid understanding of binary trees, their applications, and how to implement and manipulate them efficiently using the C programming language. The project emphasizes both theoretical knowledge and practical coding skills, making it a valuable learning experience for C programmers interested in data structures and algorithms.
